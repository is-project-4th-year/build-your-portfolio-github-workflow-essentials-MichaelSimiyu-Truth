## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program
- **Issue Tracking**: Helped me break down the project into smaller manageable tasks. It made it easier to focus on one feature at a time and link progress to milestones and pull requests.
- **Pull Requests**: Enabled clear code reviews and testing before merging features to the main branch.
- **Proper Commit Conventions**: Improved code history readability by using structured commit types like `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, etc.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: I learned how to resolve conflicting code changes manually using both GitHub and VS Code tools.
